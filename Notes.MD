Here, if we input nothing to the category, the Category object will still be created. But when write to the database, as some fields are not nullable, so that it will cause Exception. At this moment, the category model 's Name property is [required], but we need add some code to make server side validaton work. without those code, eventhought we have some validation attributes, the Framework will do nothing.
3-8-2: Add some validaton tag helper to the front end. By doing this, once the ModelState.IsValid==false, will redirect to Page(), and some Red color error message will display. Be aware, this is still server side validation because you still can click the "Create" and pass the invalid value to the server side. So it cannot prevent invalid value be passed to the server side , it is not Client side validation. Client side validation must can prevent invalid value be passed to the server side.
